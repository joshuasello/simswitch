# **switchsim**  
*A Python Package for Automating GaN Device Simulations and Analysis*

---

### **Description**

**switchsim** is a Python package designed to streamline the simulation and analysis of power electronic circuits, with a focus on Gallium Nitride (GaN) devices. Built for researchers and engineers, the package automates workflows for circuit parameter modification, simulation execution, and data extraction, enabling systematic evaluation of GaN transistors under various operating conditions.

The package integrates seamlessly with **LTSpice**, allowing users to:
- Automate **double pulse tests (DPT)** for evaluating switching losses.
- Analyze GaN devices in **buck converter topologies** to assess steady-state performance.
- Conduct **parametric sweeps** over voltage, current, temperature, and gate resistance.
- Visualize simulation results with clear, customizable plots.
